# The [movie search](https://dzmitry-duboyski-movie-search.netlify.app) application is designed to search for movies and get information about the movie.

## The application has the following functions:
1. Search for movies by movie name. To find information about films, the API is used - OMDb API.
2. Implemented adding movies to favorites, with saving after reloading the page (storage in localstorage).
3. Implemented pagination with automatic content loading.
4. Implemented adaptive design, which allows you to comfortably work with the application both on mobile devices and on a PC.
5. The adaptive slider / swiper is implemented using [swiperjs](https://swiperjs.com/api).
6. View detailed information about the film (when you click on the poster of the film, a pop-up will open and detailed information about the film).
